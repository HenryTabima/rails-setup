# Contributing Guidelines

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Rails-Setup. Itâ€™s people like you that make this project great.

## How to

* Make sure that nobody else is already working on what you want to contribute (check Issues and PRs).
* Raise an issue explaining what you want in the project and if you are going to take care of it.
* fork the project and work on a different branch from master.
* send a pull request

## Type of contributions

* [Misspelling fixes](#misspelling-fixes)
* [Fix documentation issues](#fix-documentation-issues)
* [Add documentation for common Rails related libraries](#add-documentation-for-common-rails-related-libraries)

### Misspelling fixes

As humans we are prone to erros, including misspelling. if you see any please rise an issue.

### Fix documentation issues

Most of the documentation added is just copied from the original projects, sometimes it comes with links to images and another pages that get broke once you put in here. you can help fixing that kind of things.

### Add documentation for common Rails related libraries

You could bring here documentation from another project that usually dont have their own documentation website or maybe their website is not friendly enough.

## Roadmap

the idea is to have documentatios by topic and library. like:

* Rails
* Authentication
  * devise
  * jwt
  * others libraries...
* Testing
  * minitest
  * rspec
  * others...
* Commonly used
  * Faker
  * Factory bot

The ultimate goal is to have all what you need to achieve whatever you want in your rails project. All in one place. all easy to navigate.
