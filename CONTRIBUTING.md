### Misspelling fixes

As humans we are prone to erros, including misspelling. if you see any please rise an issue.

### Fix documentation issues

Most of the documentation added is just copied from the original projects, sometimes it comes with links to images and another pages that get broke once you put in here. you can help fixing that kind of things.

### Add documentation for common Rails related libraries

You could bring here documentation from another project that usually dont have their own documentation website or maybe their website is not friendly enough.

### Enhancing the website

If you have cool ideas to imporve the look and feel of the index or any other page, please raise an issue explaining what do you have in mind.

## Roadmap

the idea is to have documentatios by topic and library. like:

* Rails
* Authentication
  * devise
  * jwt
  * others libraries...
* Testing
  * minitest
  * rspec
  * others...
* Commonly used
  * Faker
  * Factory bot

The ultimate goal is to have all what you need to achieve whatever you want in your rails project. All in one place. all easy to navigate.
