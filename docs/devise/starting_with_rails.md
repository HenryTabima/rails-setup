If you are building your first Rails application, we recommend you *do not* use Devise. Devise requires a good understanding of the Rails Framework. In such cases, we advise you to start a simple authentication system from scratch. Today, we have three resources that should help you get started:

* Michael Hartl's online book: https://www.railstutorial.org/book/modeling_users
* Ryan Bates' Railscast: http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch
* Codecademy's Ruby on Rails: Authentication and Authorization: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/rails-auth

Once you have solidified your understanding of Rails and authentication mechanisms, we assure you Devise will be very pleasant to work with. :smiley:
